# Vision-Based-Sorting-System

this project is concerned with the development of a high-speed sorting system based on Machine Vision that can segregate carton boxes on the main belt conveyor. This technology will benefit the industry in a variety of ways. The technology has a big potential in the various FMCG sectors, from saving labor costs and effort of recognizing (a product in a carton box) and then relocating that carton to another conveyor or workbench to saving a lot of time and eliminating human mistake. As a result, our objective is to create a low-cost Automated sorting system that can be used in local companies to assist them enhance production. Local industry development is essential for each country's economic progress.

The vision-based high-speed sorting system will make use of a Vision Camera connected to a Raspberry Pi microcontroller. The arriving carton box on the conveyor will be detected by the camera. An ArUco Marker will be printed on the side of the Carton box, which the camera will detect. A box will be sorted based on the product identified by the camera. Soring mechanisms can be of several forms. Pneumatic sorting is commonly utilized because to its low cost, which is a crucial concern for any company. The carton box will be sorted by a pneumatic sorting system consisting of a cylinder, valves, and an end effector after being detected by the camera.
